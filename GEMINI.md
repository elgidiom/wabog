# Project Overview

This is a static website for a product called "WABOG - Gestión legal inteligente" (intelligent legal management). It is a single-page landing page with sections for features, pricing, and a footer with legal information. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It uses Bootstrap for its grid system and has a custom stylesheet for the main design.

# Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

The project uses a simple and clean coding style.

*   **HTML:** The HTML is well-structured and uses semantic tags.
*   **CSS:** The CSS is organized and uses variables for colors and fonts. It also includes media queries for responsive design.
*   **JavaScript:** The JavaScript is written in a single file (`main.js`) and handles theme toggling and the mobile menu.

There are no explicit contribution guidelines, but the code is easy to understand and modify.

# Design conventions

The design conventions are as follows:

*   **Colors:** The colors are defined in the CSS and are used consistently throughout the site.

*   **Typography:** The typography is defined in the CSS and is used consistently throughout the site.

*   **Layout:** The layout is defined in the CSS and is used consistently throughout the site.

*   **Images:** The images are defined in the CSS and are used consistently throughout the site.

*   **Buttons:** The buttons are defined in the CSS and are used consistently throughout the site.
